    // if the state is an array, we should never change it. We have to always create a new array,
    // and then use the "setState" function.
    // If we update the array of the state "board" we will be updating the state without calling
    // "setBoard", and that could cause discrepancies in the rendering
    // the data of the new state always has to be new.
